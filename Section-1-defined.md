# Section 1: Data Handling and Functionality

This document shows the main bullet points for section one of the outline and suggestions for what kind of questions you should be asking to help flesh out the details. 

- **Data Entry and Validation**: Implement logic to capture user input, validate it against the selected data type, and provide feedback on errors.
- **Object Handling**: Manage the objects, including adding, editing, and deleting.
- **File Generation**: Convert the objects and data to a downloadable file.

### 1. Data Types:
- **Task**: Define the supported data types.
- **Questions**:
  - Which data types will the application support?
  - Are there any specific formats or constraints for each data type?
  - How will users select the data type?
  - Will the Data type be auto-detected?
  - Should there be default options for commonly used data types?

### 2. Input Interface:
- **Task**: Create an interface for users based on selected data types.
- **Questions**:
  - What elements should be included in the input form? Text, buttons, hardware?
  - Should the input interface adjust dynamically based on the selected data type?
  - Are there any specific UI patterns or controls to consider for different data types (e.g., date pickers, checkboxes)?

### 3. Data Entry and Validation:
- **Task**: Implement logic to capture user input, validate it against the selected data type, and provide feedback on errors.
- **Questions**:
  - What validation rules should be applied to each data type (e.g., required fields, format validation)?
  - How should the application handle invalid inputs?
  - Should there be real-time validation or validation triggered on form submission?
  - Are there any edge cases or special scenarios to consider for validation?

### 4. Object Handling:
- **Task**: Manage the objects, including adding, editing, and deleting.
- **Questions**:
  - How will the application manage the objects internally?
  - Should users be able to edit or delete previously entered data?
  - How will the application handle nested objects and arrays?
  - Are there any performance considerations for managing large object structures?

### 5. File Generation:
- **Task**: Convert the objects and data to a downloadable file.
- **Questions**:
  - How should the object be converted into a downloadable file?
  - What should be the structure and formatting of the generated file?
  - Are there any additional metadata or headers to include in the file?
  - Should users have any control over the file generation process (e.g., choosing file name or location)?
  - what format should the file be?

By asking these questions and considering the specific requirements and constraints of your project, you can define each aspect of the "Data Handling and Functionality" section more precisely. This detailed planning will help ensure that the application meets user needs effectively and functions reliably.
