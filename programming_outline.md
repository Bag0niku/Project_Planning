### 1. Data Handling and Functionality:
- **Data Types**: Define the supported data types for input, including strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, null, dates, and integers.
- **Input Interface**: Create a form-based interface for users to input data, with dynamic adjustments based on the selected data type.
- **Data Entry and Validation**: Implement logic to capture user input, validate it against the selected data type, and provide feedback on errors.
- **Object Handling**: Manage the objects, including adding, editing, and deleting.
- **File Generation**: Convert the objects and data to a downloadable file.

### 2. User Interface (UI):
- **Visual Design**: Define the aesthetics of the application, including colors, typography, and layout.
- **Layout and Components**: Arrange UI elements such as input fields, dropdown menus, and buttons for optimal usability and visual appeal.
- **Responsiveness**: Ensure that the interface adapts well to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Accessibility**: Implement design principles that make the interface usable for people with disabilities.

### 3. User Experience (UX):
- **User Interaction**: Design how users interact with the interface elements, including form validation, feedback messages, and error handling.
- **Flow and Navigation**: Define the sequence of actions users take to accomplish tasks and ensure that navigation is intuitive and efficient.
- **Feedback and Guidance**: Provide clear and timely feedback to guide users through the process.
- **Consistency and Familiarity**: Maintain consistency in terminology, layout, and behavior to create a familiar and predictable experience.

### 4. Security:
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement mechanisms to verify user identities and control access to sensitive functionality or data.
- **Data Security**: Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit to protect it from unauthorized access.
- **Secure Communication**: Use HTTPS protocol to encrypt communication between the client and server.
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling mechanisms to avoid leaking sensitive information.
- **File Handling**: Implement secure file handling practices to prevent unauthorized access or execution of files uploaded by users.

### 5. Testing and Iteration:
- **Testing Strategy**: Plan how the application will be tested to ensure functionality and security.
- **Feedback Collection**: Gather feedback from users and stakeholders to identify areas for improvement.
- **Iteration Cycle**: Incorporate feedback into the development process and iterate on the design and functionality of the application.
- **Bug Fixing**: Address any bugs or issues discovered during testing promptly.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the application for performance to ensure responsiveness and efficiency.
